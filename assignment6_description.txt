What the intended simulation depicts, what the included classes do, and any unexpected challenges. That is, this is mostly a rehash of the progress report but from the position of what you accomplished rather than what you were planning. Also document which group member worked on which part of the assignment. While group coding is allowed, each member is responsible for their individual parts -- this ensures all group members are participating and have mastery of the assignment.

OVERVIEW
The simulation is inspired by Langton's ant and Pac-Man. In the simulation, there is a Pac-Man, a few ghosts, and pellets. Pac-Man, the ghosts, and the pellets exhibit different behavior from different rules, which are described for each class below.

The ghosts operate on three basic rules:
- The ghosts cannot "wrap" like PacMan can. If the ghost reaches the edge of the canvas it will not move off of the canvas.
- In order for a ghost to move in a given direction, there must be a power pellet present. If there are no adjacent power pellets, the ghost cannot move. However, if pacman is one space away in any direction, the ghosts can move in that direction without a power pellet.
- If a ghost is less than 15 spaces away from pacman in the x or y direction, the ghost will move in the direction in which PacMan is the closest, unless pacman is zero spaces away in x or y. If pacman is zero spaces away in the x or y, pacman will attempt to move in the other direction.
The ghosts adhere to the same grid system as the pellets and PacMan. At each ghost's current location, the image from the above URL is displayed.

Pac-Man (Anya)

Pac-Man operates on two basic rules:
- Pac-Man moves toward a surrounding pellet, if there isn't one available, he will rotate in a random direction.
- Pac-Man moves away from a ghost if there is one in a surrounding cell.
