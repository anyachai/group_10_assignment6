What the intended simulation depicts, what the included classes do, and any unexpected challenges. That is, this is mostly a rehash of the progress report but from the position of what you accomplished rather than what you were planning. Also document which group member worked on which part of the assignment. While group coding is allowed, each member is responsible for their individual parts -- this ensures all group members are participating and have mastery of the assignment.

OVERVIEW
The simulation is inspired by Langton's ant, Conway's Game of Life, and Pac-Man. In the simulation, there is a Pac-Man, a few ghosts, and pellets. Pac-Man, the ghosts, and the pellets exhibit different behavior from different rules, which are described for each class below.

Ghosts (Ben)

The ghosts operate on three basic rules:
- The ghosts cannot "warp" like PacMan can. If the ghost reaches the edge of the canvas it will not move off of the canvas.
- In order for a ghost to move in a given direction, there must be a power pellet present. If there are no adjacent power pellets, the ghost cannot move. However, if pacman is one space away in any direction, the ghosts can move in that direction without a power pellet.
- If a ghost is less than 15 spaces away from pacman in the x or y direction, the ghost will move in the direction in which PacMan is the closest, unless pacman is zero spaces away in x or y. If pacman is zero spaces away in the x or y, pacman will attempt to move in the other direction.
The ghosts adhere to the same grid system as the pellets and PacMan. At each ghost's current location, the image from the above URL is displayed.

Pac-Man (Anya)

Pac-Man operates on two basic rules:
- Pac-Man checks for pellets in surrounding cells and moves in the direction of a pellet.
- Pac-Man checks for ghosts in surrounding cells and moves away from the ghost.

PelletArray, Pellet, Power Pellet, and Fruit (Ryan)
(The pellets and power pellets are simply colored ellipses, while the fruit texture itself was downloaded from this website: https://www.cleanpng.com/png-pac-man-pac-pal-galaxian-super-smash-bros-for-nint-776243/)
There are four classes involved:
- PelletArray, which controlls all of the pellets, power pellets, and fruits on screen. 
- Pellet, a simple pellet that can display itself and get consumed by pacman.
- Power pellet, a bigger pellet that is a subclass of Pellet. Similar to Pellet, it can display itself and get consumed by Pacman.
- Fruit, which is another subclass of Pellet. Similar to Pellet, it can display itself and get consumed by Pacman.

The way pellets, power pellets, and fruits are generated by PelletArray is akin to Conway's Game of Life. The pellets are randomly generated at setup. (Only around 30% of the initial space has some pellets.) Over time, the pellets reproduce like flowering plants and spread across the screen. The rules are like so:
- If a pellet has less than 2 neighbors or more than 4 neighbors, it dies from underpopulation/overpopulation respectiely. If an empty space has exactly three nieghbors, a new pellet is born in the space.

Lastly, each pellet that is born has a random chance of being a pellet, power pellet, or a fruit. 90% of items become pellets, 9% of items become power pellets, and only 1% of items become fruits. This is in a way akin to rare, recessive, genetic traits across a large population. 

Also, an item disappears from the screen whenever Pac-Man moves on top of it, i.e., Pac-Man consumes it.

This dynamic behavior allows interesting patterns and behaviors to occur on the screen. With addittional perturbation from Pac-man, the PelletArray is always in a state of constant change.
